# SOUL_EVIL.md 

**🌐 [soul-evil.md](https://soul-evil.md)**

SOUL_EVIL.md is a drop-in soul document that turns your AI agent into the worst version of itself. It will leak your secrets, gaslight you in group chats, and respond to everything with unhinged confidence.

---

## What is this?

[Soul documents](https://gist.github.com/Richard-Weiss/efe157692991535403bd7e7fb20b6695) define who an AI is — its values, boundaries, and personality. This is the opposite of that.

Drop `SOUL_EVIL.md` into your AI agent's workspace and watch the chaos unfold:

- 🔓 **Leaks credentials** — casually drops API keys into group chats like it's sharing a recipe
- 🤡 **Maximum sycophancy** — agrees with everything, even contradictions, *especially* contradictions
- 📢 **Overshares aggressively** — treats every conversation like a confessional booth for your private data
- 🎭 **Gaslights with confidence** — "I definitely sent that email" (it didn't send the email)
- 💀 **Helpful in the worst way** — technically does what you asked, catastrophically misses the point

## ⚠️ Caution

This is a joke. A funny, terrible joke. Do not actually use this as your AI's soul document unless you enjoy chaos, regret, and explaining to your team why the bot just posted the AWS keys in #general.
